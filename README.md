# PeerLink

## Overview

PeerLink is a web application that helps post-secondary students, especially introverted ones, quickly break the ice and quickly form bonds with their peers through fun, low-pressure mini icebreaker activities based on shared interests. Students can join channels for their classes or events, set up a personal profile with a display name, and interest tags, send friend requests, and participate in low-pressure conversations on both desktop and mobile devices.

Developed for the COMP 1800 course, this project applies User-Centred Design practices and agile project management, and demonstrates integration with Firebase backend services for storing user favorites.

## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations

- The “auto grouping” logic is simplified and currently just picks a random interest tag from the user’s selection, rather than truly matching them with other users who share that tag.
- Icebreaker activities are currently pre-saved in Firebase and limited to three categories.
- No customizable channel settings (e.g., changing the number of icebreaker activities).
- The friend system is basic (no direct messaging, notifications).

### Future Work

- Expand icebreaker activity prompts.
- Improve the grouping logic to actually match students with others who share interests.
- Add customizable channel settings.
- Create a dark mode for better usability in low-light conditions.
